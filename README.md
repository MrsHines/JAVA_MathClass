# JAVA_MathClass
Write a program that includes the 6 methods described below: 

1.	Write a method that takes in two integers as parameters and returns the result of integer division rounded up to the next integer.
2.	Write a method that takes in a double value as a parameter and prints the whole and fractional parts.
3.	Write a method that takes in the x and y coordinates for two points.  Compute the distance between the two points using the distance formula.
4.	Write a method that takes in the radius of a sphere and prints its volume and surface area.  Print the surface area and volume to 4 decimal places. 
5.	Write a method that takes in the lengths of the sides of a triangle as parameters.  Compute and return the area of the triangle using Heronâ€™s formula (below), in which s is half of the perimeter of the triangle.    
6.	Write a method that takes in an integer as a parameter and returns a random integer between 1 and that value. 

Use the BlueJ testing function to test your methods.
